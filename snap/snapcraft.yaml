 LXDUI is a Python Flask application that leverages LXD's Python client 
 library, pylxd (https://github.com/lxc/pylxd), for interacting with the LXD 
 REST API. It allows for rapid provisioning and management of large number of 
 containers from a web browser, and you can simultaneously create any number of 
 containers, even from multiple images, in one step.
